This perl script unrar files saved in different folders in a directory. Placed the new folder on the user Desktop, with both the rar files and the unrar files. The unrar will only work on *ix OS, but on Win OS, everyother thing will be done expect the "unrar" -ing of the files.

TODO
Use Module Archive::Unrar from www.cpan.org to unrar on win OS.
